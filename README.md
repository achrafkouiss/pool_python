## 🌱 Overview

From growing digital gardens to exploring cyberpunk data systems, interstellar data pipelines, and functional programming adventures, this collection covers **everything a Python learner needs**:

* Python basics: syntax, control flow, data types
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Exception handling & robust code practices
* Data structures & streaming pipelines
* File operations, context managers, and modular programming
* Abstract classes, interfaces, and polymorphism
* Package management, virtual environments, and environment variables
* Data validation with **Pydantic**
* Advanced functional programming: higher-order functions, decorators, and lambdas

Each module is **self-contained** and demonstrates exercises along with my personal solutions, making this an excellent portfolio showcase.
